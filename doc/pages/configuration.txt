Format
======
Hockeypuck reads a TOML-format configuration file for setting various
options on the subsystems and features of the service.

Quickstart
==========
When run without any configuration, Hockeypuck will assume the following:

* Service HKP requests on port 11371 (all interfaces).
* SKS and PKS public key synchronization methods are disabled.
* Default PostgreSQL connection settings:

  - Connect to PostgreSQL via local UNIX domain socket in /var/run/postgresql.
  - Connect to a database named 'hkp', accessible and modifiable by the user executing Hockeypuck.

* Public key signatures will not be verified on /pks/add or bulk loading.
* Static media files are expected to be in $GOPATH/src/launchpad.net/hockeypuck/instroot/var/lib/postgresql/www.
* Log messages written to stderr.

These and other options can be customized as follows.

[hockeypuck]
============
General settings for the overall service.

logfile=\ *"/path/to/hockeypuck.log"*
-------------------------------------
Path where log messages should be written.

Type
    Quoted string
Default
    Hockeypuck logs messages to standard error.

[hockeypuck.hkp]
================
HTTP Keyserver Protocol settings.

bind=\ *"[address]:port"*
-------------------------
Listen on address:port for HKP requests. Omit address to accept requests to this port on any interface.

Type
    Quoted string
Default
    ":11371"

webroot=\ *"/path/to/hockeypuck/media/www"*
-------------------------------------------
Path to the static media files used to serve Hockeypuck's HTML web UI.

Type
    Quoted string
Default
    "$GOPATH/src/launchpad.net/hockeypuck/instroot/var/lib/hockeypuck/www"

    (Note that environment variables are not evaluated for configured values of webroot.)
 
[hockeypuck.openpgp]
====================
OpenPGP service settings.

verifySigs=\ *(boolean value)*
------------------------------
When true, Hockeypuck will attempt to verify every self-signed packet
that it can, and store the status in the signature packet's STATE column.
This is used to enhance the quality of the keyserver results at the expense of performance.
Any user of this service must independently verify signatures for security even when enabled.

Type
    boolean
Default
    false

nworkers=\ *(int, > 0)*
-----------------------
Number of workers that will concurrently load key material into
the database & prefix tree.

Type
    int
Default
    # of detected cores

[hockeypuck.openpgp.db]
=======================
OpenPGP database connection options.

driver="postgres"
-----------------
The only supported database/sql driver is "postgres".

dsn=\ "*(postgres connection string)*"
--------------------------------------
PostgreSQL connection string. See https://github.com/lib/pq for more information
on the format and supported parameters.

Type
    Quoted string
Default
    "dbname=hkp host=/var/run/postgresql sslmode=disable"

    This connects through a local socket to database 'hkp' owned by the effective user)

[conflux.recon]
===============
Options for `Conflux <https://github.com/cmars/conflux>`_, which provides SKS reconciliation protocol support for Hockeypuck.

reconPort=\ *(int, port number)*
--------------------------------
Listen port for the SKS recon protocol. All interfaces will listen on this address.
Use this port in a remote SKS membership file to peer SKS with Hockeypuck.

Type
    int
Default
    11370

httpPort=\ *(int, port number)*
-------------------------------
HTTP port reported to peer. This must match the port specified for
hockeypuck.hkp.bind.

Type
    int
Default
    11371

partners=\ *\["addr1:port1","addr2:port2",...,"addrN:portN"\]*
--------------------------------------------------------------
List of peers Hockeypuck will gossip with. This is Hockeypuck's
equivalent to the SKS membership file.

Type
    List of quoted strings
Default
    Empty list
Example
    partners=["sks1.cmarstech.com:11370","sks2.cmarstech.com:11370"]

filters=\ *\["filter1","filter2",...,"filterN"\]*
-------------------------------------------------
SKS filters, which must match your peers' configuration. Hockeypuck
doesn't really interpret this setting. De-duplication and key merging
are not optional filters, they are the only supported mode of operation.
This setting is currently provided for SKS compatibility purposes only.
Future filters may be supported by Hockeypuck.

Type
    List of quoted strings
Default
    Empty list
Example
    filters=["yminsky.dedup"]

[conflux.recon.gkvlite]
=======================
Conflux stores public key digests in a persistent prefix tree data structure.

path=\ *"/path/to/recon-ptree"*
-------------------------------
Path to the flat file where the prefix tree is persisted.

Type
    Quoted string
Default
    path="$(pwd)/recon-ptree"

[hockeypuck.openpgp.pks]
========================
PKS is an older protocol for public keyserver synchronization over email.

Hockeypuck stores a timestamp per downstream email address.
Hockeypuck will periodically send all public keys updated since the last downstream send.

to=\ *\["user@pkshost1","user@pkshost2",..."user@pkshostN"\]*
-------------------------------------------------------------
Send keys to these downstream PKS servers.

Type
    List of quoted string

from=\ *"pgp-public-keys@yourhost.yourdomain.com"*
--------------------------------------------------
PKS sync *mail from:* address, which should be a valid address upon which
hockeypuck can receive PKS mail. This address is displayed on the op=stats
page for peering purposes.

Type
    Quoted string

[hockeypuck.openpgp.pks.smtp]
=============================
Custom SMTP settings for sending PKS mail. The default is to connect locally to an SMTP server on port 25.

host=\ *"address:port"*
-------------------------
SMTP server to connect to send outbound PKS mail.

Type
    Quoted string
Example
    host="smtp.google.com:587"

user=\ *"(smtp.username)"*
--------------------------
SMTP account username, if necessary.

Type
    Quoted string

pass=\ *"(smtp password)"*
--------------------------
SMTP account password, if necessary.
